# Resume

Hi! I'm Dmitry, a web developer from St. Petersburg, Russia with 4 years of experience in the field of professional web development.

## I code

- ### Ruby

    Most of my ruby code rests in private codebases, so there's not much to show here, yet I consider the folowing examples representative

    - My pull requests to `saintpruby_bot`, a telegram bot for our local community's ruby conference, for example [this][Keyboard dsl], [this][Talk command] and [this][Fallbacks & cleanup]
    - My pull requests to `uploadcare-ruby` gem, for example [this][Secure Auth] and [this][ResourceList]
    - Useless yet interesting [patme][patme] gem (with 75â˜…) that implements elixir-style pattern matching (I've written it some time ago on a dare)
    - [Test task][SPBTV test task] for my previous employer (SPB TV AG)
    - [telegram bot][telegram bot] that I've written for personal purposes

- ### JS

    Being mostly a ruby developer, I know and like JS, but have quite a few publicly available examples of my JS code. Here are some of them, written for my personal experiments with graphics. Note that they are all 2 or more years old (don't trust commit timestamps)

    - 2d: particles ([code][js particles code], [live demo][js particles demo] looks better in night mode)
    - 3d: lightning ([code][js lishtning code], [live demo][js lishtning demo]), texturing ([code][js texturing code], [live demo][js texturing demo])
